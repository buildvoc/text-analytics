whole building ventilation  (general ventilation) is nominally continuous ventilation of rooms or spaces at a relatively low rate to dilute and remove pollutants and water vapour not removed by operation of extract ventilation, purge ventilation or infiltration, as well as supplying outdoor air into the building. For an individual dwelling this is referred to as ‘whole dwelling ventilation’.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_63df1a7b>
intermittent operation is where a mechanical ventilator does not run all the time, usually running only when there is a particular need to remove pollutants or water vapour (e.g. during cooking or bathing). Intermittent operation may be under either manual control or automatic control.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_eb6a5187>
purge ventilation is manually controlled ventilation of rooms or spaces at a relatively high rate to rapidly dilute pollutants and/or water vapour.

key terms (adf) The following are key terms used in this\ndocument:	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_59a3ae21>
surface water activity is a measure of the availability of water to micro-organisms, and is determined from the ratio of the vapour pressure of the water in the substrate to that of pure water at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is, in steady-state conditions, numerically equal to the equilibrium relative humidity of the air, except that the latter is commonly expressed as a percentage (from IEA Annex 14 source book, 1991).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_92db7c07>
utility room is a room containing a sink or other feature or equipment which may reasonably be expected to produce water vapour in significant quantities.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_67f6207e>
background ventilator is a small ventilation opening designed to provide controllable whole building ventilation. See Diagram 1.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_f3c590e2>
purpose-provided ventilation is that part of the ventilation of a building provided by ventilation devices designed into the building (e.g. via background ventilators, PSV, extract fans, mechanical ventilation or air-conditioning systems).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_32d39119>
permanent opening is a ventilation opening which is permanently fixed in the open position.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_a8de44e3>
continuous operation is where a mechanical ventilation device runs all the time, e.g. mechanical extract ventilation (MEV) and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR). The air flow rate provided by the mechanical ventilation need not be constant but may be varied, under either manual or automatic control, in response to the demand for pollutant or water vapour removal.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_2842eb4b>
automatic control is where a ventilation device is opened and closed or switched on and off or its performance is adjusted by a mechanical or electronic controller which responds to a relevant stimulus. That stimulus is usually related to the humidity of the air in a room, pollutant levels (e.g. carbon dioxide concentration in a room), occupancy of the space (e.g. using a passive infra-red motion detector) or pressure difference across the device (e.g. due to the wind outside).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_03fe243e>
ventilation is the supply and removal of air (by natural and/or mechanical means) to and from a space or spaces in a building. It normally comprises a combination of purpose-provided ventilation and infiltration.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_d10595f3>

capacity The of an oil tank is its nominal capacity as stated by the manufacturer. It is usually 95 per cent of the volume of liquid required to fill it to the brim.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_8c3e4b6f>
chimney  is a structure consisting of a wall or walls enclosing one or more flues (see Diagram 2). In the gas industry, the chimney for a gas appliance is commonly called the flue.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_4a83bd38>
combustion appliance (or appliance)  is an apparatus where fuel is burned to generate heat for space heating, water heating, cooking or other similar purpose. The appliance does not include systems to deliver fuel to it or for the distribution of heat. Typical combustion appliances are boilers, warm air heaters, water heaters, fires, stoves and cookers.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_cf1e8e52>
designation system in BS EN 1443:2003 expresses the performance characteristics of a chimney or its components, as assessed in accordance with an appropriate European product standard, by means of a code such as EN 1234 – T400 N1 D1 Gxx. Further information is given in Appendix G.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_7390c895>
draught break is an opening formed by a factory-made component into any part of the flue serving an open-flued appliance. Such openings may be provided to allow dilution air to be drawn into a flue or to lessen the effects of down-draught on combustion in the appliance	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_ee1dbf01>
draught diverter is a form of draught break intended to prevent conditions in the main length of flue from interfering with the combustion performance of an open-flued appliance (see Diagram 3(a)). It allows the appliance to operate without interference from down- draughts that may occur in adverse wind conditions and excessive draught.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_119d7903>
draught stabiliser is a factory-made counter-balanced flap device admitting air to the flue, from the same space as the combustion air, to prevent excessive variations in the draught (see Diagram 3(b)). It is usual for these to be in the fluepipe or chimney, but they may be located on the appliance.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_bfc3ac08>
equivalent area is defined in BS EN 13141 -1:2004 as the area of a sharp-edged circular orifice which would pass the same air flow rate at the same applied pressure difference as the product or device being tested. The equivalent area of a simple ventilator will be less than the geometrical free area and for complex products may be significantly less.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_d55b06b8>
factory-made metal chimneys (also known as system chimneys) are prefabricated chimneys that are commonly manufactured as sets of components for assembly on site (although they can be supplied as one unit), having the performance appropriate for the intended appliance. They are available in various materials and types ranging from single-walled metal chimneys suitable for some gas appliances to twin-walled chimneys with insulation sandwiched between an inner liner and an outer metal wall which are designed for oil or solid fuel use.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_0ef5294b>
fanned draught installation the proper discharge of the flue gases depends upon the operation of a fan, which may be separately installed in the flue or may be an integral part of the combustion appliance. Fans in combustion appliances either may extract flue gases from the combustion chamber or may cause the flue gases to be displaced from the combustion chamber if the fan is supplying it with air for combustion. Appliances with fans providing the combustion air (including most oil-fired and many gas- fired boilers) are also commonly referred to as forced draught appliances (see Diagram 4). Flues in fanned draught installations run horizontally or vertically and can be at higher or lower pressures than their surroundings, dependent upon the location of the fan.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_17d58c6d>
fire compartment is a building or part of a building comprising one or more rooms, spaces or storeys constructed to prevent the spread of fire to or from another part of the same building or an adjoining building. (A roof-10. space above the top storey of a fire compartment is included in that fire compartment.) 	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_ed23b7cc>
separated part of a building is a form of compartmentation in which part of a building is separated from another part of the same building by a compartment wall. Such walls run the full height of the part and are in one vertical plane. Further information on this is given in Approved Document B Vol 2 (see Section 8 Compartmentation and Appendix C Methods of Measurement).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_870f938c>
fireplace recess is a structural opening (sometimes called a builder’s opening) formed in a wall or in a chimney breast, from which a chimney leads and which has a hearth at its base. Simple structural openings (Diagram 5(a)) are suitable for closed appliances such as stoves, cookers or boilers, but gathers (Diagram 5(b)) are necessary for accommodating open fires. Fireplace recesses are often lined with firebacks to accommodate inset open fires (Diagram 5(c)). Lining components and decorative treatments fitted around openings reduce the opening area. It is the finished fireplace opening area which determines the size of flue required for an open fire in such a recess.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_45847832>
fire resistance of a component or construction is a measure of its ability to withstand the effects of fire in one or more ways for a stated period of time. Guidance on determination of performance in terms of fire resistance is given in Approved Document B (Fire Safety).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_9ab3dc4c>
fire wall is a means of shielding a fuel tank from the thermal radiation from a fire. For  LPG tanks, it also ensures that gas accidentally leaking from the tank or fittings must travel by a longer path and therefore disperse safely, before reaching a hazard such as an opening in a building, a boundary or other potential ignition source.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_3a3a6363>
flue is a passage that conveys the products of combustion from an appliance to the outside air (see Diagram 2).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_12b20158>
flueblock chimney systems consist of a set of factory-made components, made from precast concrete, clay or other masonry units, that are designed for assembly on site to provide a complete chimney having the performance appropriate for the intended appliance. There are two types of common systems, one being solely for use with gas- burning appliances and the other, often called chimney block systems, being primarily designed for solid fuel-burning appliances.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_3a623af3>
flue box is a factory made unit, usually made of metal, which is similar to a prefabricated appliance chamber except that it is designed to accommodate a gas burning appliance in conjunction with a factory-made chimney.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_7f8af2c2>
flueless appliance is one which is designed to be used without connection to a flue. Its products of combustion mix with the surrounding room air and are eventually transported to the outside as stale air leaves the room (see Diagram 4(g)).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_9e940521>
flue liner is the wall of the chimney that is in contact with the products of combustion (see Diagram 2), such as a concrete flue liner, the inner liner of a factory-made chimney system or a flexible liner fitted into an existing chimney.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_e9c0c7da>
flue outlet is the point at which the products of combustion are discharged from the flue to the outside atmosphere, such as the top of a chimney pot or flue terminal.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_873f1974>
fluepipe is a pipe, either single walled (bare or insulated) or double walled, which connects a combustion appliance to a flue in a chimney. For clarity, when used in this way, it may be called a connecting fluepipe. (Fluepipe is also used to describe the tubular components from which some factory made chimneys for gas and oil appliances are made or from which plastic flue systems are made).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_dcbadafe>
hearth is a base intended to safely isolate a combustion appliance from people, combustible parts of the building fabric and soft furnishings. The exposed surface of the hearth provides a region around the appliance which can be kept clear of anything at risk of fire. The body of the hearth may be thin insulating board, a substantial thickness of material such as concrete or some intermediate provision dependent upon the weight and downward heat emission characteristics of the appliance(s) upon it (see Diagram 6).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_229f83e8>
heat input rate is the maximum rate of energy flow into an appliance. It is calculated as the rate of fuel flow to the appliance multiplied by either the fuel’s gross or net calorific value.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_22c38d73>
installation instructions are those instructions produced by manufacturers to enable installers to correctly install and test appliances and flues and to commission them into service.	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_53d35017>
natural draught flue the combustion products flow into the flue as a result of the draught produced due to the difference between the temperature of the gases within the flue and the temperature of the ambient air. Taller flues produce a greater draught at their base. Except for those balanced flue appliances which are designed to discharge directly through the wall adjacent to the appliance, a satisfactory natural draught requires an essentially vertical run of flue (see Diagram 4 (a) and (b)).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_41ebf78a>
non-combustible material This is the highest level of reaction to fire performance. Non-combustible materials include: a. any material which when tested to BS 476-11:1982 (2007) does not flame nor cause any rise in temperature on either the centre (specimen) or furnace thermocouples; and b. products classified as non-combustible in tests following the procedures in BS 476-4:1970 (2007); c. any material classified as class A1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1:2002 Fire classification of construction products and building elements. Classification using data from reaction to fire tests. Typical examples of such materials to be found in buildings include totally inorganic materials such as concrete, fired clay, ceramics, metals, plaster and masonry containing not more than 1 per cent by weight or volume of organic material. (Use in buildings of combustible metals such as magnesium–aluminium alloys should be assessed in each individual case.) More detailed information is given in Approved Document B (Fire Safety).	<http://buildvoc.co.uk/resource/c_ad9a7d0c>
